# Waifusion Website 

Welcome to the repo for the waifusion.sexy website - a Gatsby project implementing Web3 which allows users to interact with the Waifusion NFT project.

## Local Development Setup

To run the front end locally you can use these commands:  
`cd client`  
`npm i`  
`npm start`  
visit: http://localhost:8000/

## Where's the dungeon contract gone?

We've moved it to [here](https://github.com/waifusion/contracts) in an effort to clean up the Waifusion project. This repo now only contains the Gatsby code.
