# Waifusion Brothel

Welcome to the repo for the Waifusion Dungion feature.  
This is a project to extend on the Waifusion NFT platform to add a dungeon contract.  
This contract and feature allows users to buy waifus after the sale has ended.  
Also they are able to burn their current waifus to receive a random waifu from the dungeon.  
It is still in active development, with a plan to release circa 8th March.

## Local Development Setup

To run the front end locally you can use these commands:  
`cd client`  
`npm i`  
`npm start`  
visit: http://localhost:8000/
